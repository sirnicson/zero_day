# My First Repository as a Full-Stack Engineer

This repository, named `zero_day`, marks my first step into version control and GitHub as a full-stack engineer. It's a foundational project where I've learned to set up Git, create repositories, and make my first commit and push to GitHub.

## Project Overview

This project includes the basic setup steps required to start using Git and GitHub effectively:

1. **Git Configuration**: Configured my basic information (name, email) locally to be part of commits.
   
2. **GitHub Setup**:
   - Created the repository `zero_day` on GitHub.com using the graphic interface.
   - Repository Description: This is my first repository as a full-stack engineer.
   - Repository Visibility: Public.
   - Omitted the initial creation of README.md, .gitignore, or license files as per project requirements.

3. **Local Setup**:
   - Navigated to my home directory and created a directory named `zero_day`.
   - Initialized Git in this directory and set the remote origin to link it with the GitHub repository.
   - Created a `README.md` file using Vim, where I documented the project in Markdown format.

4. **First Commit**:
   - Added the `README.md` file to Git, committed the changes with the message "My first commit", and pushed the commit to the remote server (origin).

By completing these steps, I have successfully pushed my first file (`README.md`) to my first repository (`zero_day`) on GitHub, marking the beginning of my journey into software development and version control.

Congratulations to myself for this initial achievement in the School project!
